# you’re also buying into state of the art engineering, raw power.  
# Here’s my argument: The Lamborghini’s brand is epicenter of a balance between power, 
# innovation and i like super car.

this presentation:
# Today, We would like to talk about buying a super car. In this presentation, 
# We’ll discuss some important attributes of a car, and for our example, 
# we have chosen the Lamborghini brand.
