this message:
# My message today is that when you buying a Lamborghini Revuelto car you’re not just purchasing a car, 
# you’re also buying into state of the art engineering, raw power.  
# Here’s my argument: The Lamborghini’s brand is epicenter of a balance between power, 
# innovation and i like super car.

this outline:
# A Lamborghini represents more than transportation — it shows you've achieved something significant.
# It’s a status symbol admired around the world.

# The first topic is the current price of the car.
# Next, let’s talk about fuel economy. 
# Next to speaking of the engine.
# Finaly For the brakes it features racy high-performance carbon-ceramic brakes.


# In summary, I've talked about 4 things:The current price of the Lamborghini Revuelto, its fuel consumption, 
the strong Car, and the high-performing carbon-ceramic brakes.

# My main point was that you are not just buying a car with a Lamborghini Revuelto, you are purchasing forward-thinking engineering.
# Thank you for listening  
# Do you have any questions?

#Why is owning a Lamborghini Revuelto more than just buying a regular car?

# That’s a good question
# Answer: you are purchasing forward-thinking engineering.

# Thank your for asking
